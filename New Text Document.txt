 Across high income countries, 
877 million people (73.6% of the population) have now been fully vaccinated.12 In upper-middle
income countries that number rises to 1.6 billion (73.9%). Most of these countries also have active
booster programs for their vulnerable populations reflecting the latest WHO guidance, and in
many cases for all adults. In general, these countries were able to strike individual bilateral deals
with COVID-19 vaccine manufactures to secure relatively early deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines. 
When combined with strong and well-funded health systems this allowed higher income countries
to plan in advance and introduce successful mass vaccination strategies that were rolled out
over the course of 2021. Upper-middle income countries were not able to move as fast as higherincome countries but have gradually caught up. 70% of the population of G20 count


The CoVDP and partners are providing concerted support to 34 countries that
were at or below 10% coverage in January 2022 and off track to achieve the WHO’s
70% global coverage target by June 2022. It is providing the 10 countries facing the greatest
challenges with immediate support on a rotating basis16
 to help them address bottlenecks (see
figure 5). The CoVDP works with countries and partners based on a ‘One Country Team’, ‘One Plan’,
and ‘One Budget’17 approach to understand bottlenecks to vaccination. Countries are supported to
access urgent operational funding, technical assistance, political engagement and demand and
supply planning required to plan, implement and scale their vaccination response and monitor
progress towards targets. The World Bank has approved vaccine operations in 27 of the 34 countries
and in line with country requests is closely aligning its financing and support to overcoming the
bottlenecks identified through the One Country Team approach.
